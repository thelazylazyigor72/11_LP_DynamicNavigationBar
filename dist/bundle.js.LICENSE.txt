//! Thats how to use svg, as a fucking component, so if u wanna use svg like in the image - u have to use different way

//!But, we just make a file w/ arrays that describes our links/socials and everywhere else we just populating them w/map or we populate them w/map 

//!Why we just dont hardcode links/socials, Heres the thing, what if our links/socials are also used in like sidebar or footer,

//!in the file into some exporting fragment or smth, and then if theres some changes in links/social we just make thoose changes in the file
